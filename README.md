# ✅ US Emissions Dashboard 
## Overview
In this project, I worked with a dataset provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to analyze emissions across the United States in 2023. The goal was to build a Databricks‑powered dashboard that breaks down where emissions originate and how they vary by location and population.

The data used in this project was collected by the EPA in 2023.

## What I Did
- Used Databricks to ingest, clean, transform, and visualize a large emissions dataset.

- Analyzed emissions at both the state and county levels to identify the highest‑emitting regions.

- Calculated emissions per capita and emissions per square area to provide deeper context beyond raw totals.

- Built visualizations to help the EPA understand:

Which states and counties contribute the most emissions

How emissions compare relative to population size

Geographic patterns and environmental hotspots across the country

## Outcome
The final dashboard provides a clear, data‑driven view of emissions distribution across the U.S., helping stakeholders quickly identify problem areas and make informed environmental decisions.

## ✅ Dashboard Interpretation: United States Emissions Breakdown (2023)
### 🌍 1. Continental U.S. Emissions Map
This map gives a geographic overview of emissions across the United States. Larger or denser markers represent higher total emissions, highlighting regional patterns — particularly elevated emissions in states like Texas, Florida, Illinois, and California. It provides an immediate visual sense of where pollution is most concentrated.

### 👥 2. Emissions vs Population Scatter Plot
This chart compares population size with emissions per person. The key insight **“Higher populations tend to have lower emissions per person,”** suggests that densely populated states often benefit from more efficient infrastructure, cleaner energy mixes, or urbanized living patterns. Less populated regions may rely more heavily on high‑emission industries or have fewer efficiency measures in place.

### 🥧 3. Top 10 States Contributing 51% of Total Emissions
The pie chart shows that emissions are heavily concentrated in a small group of states.

Notably:

- Texas (20.63%) and Florida (16.47%) alone account for over one‑third of national emissions.

- Other major contributors include Ohio, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.

This concentration indicates that targeted policies in just a handful of states could significantly reduce national emissions.

### 📊 **4. Top Emitting Counties**
The bar chart highlights the counties with the highest total emissions.  
The top contributors include:
- **Maricopa County, AZ (9.81M mT CO₂e)**  
- **Harris County, TX (9.68M)**  
- **Cook County, IL (8.11M)**  
- **Miami‑Dade County, FL (5.62M)**  
- **Dallas County, TX (5.43M)**  

These counties are typically large population centers or industrial hubs, which explains their high emissions. This view helps pinpoint specific localities where interventions could be most effective.

### ✅ **Overall Insight**
The dashboard reveals several key patterns in U.S. emissions for 2023:

- Emissions are **geographically uneven**, with certain states and counties dominating the totals.

- **Higher population does not equal higher per‑person emissions** In fact, the opposite trend appears.

- A small number of states and counties account for a **disproportionately large share** of national emissions.

- These insights can guide policymakers toward **targeted, high‑impact environmental strategies**.
