# US Emissions Dashboard
In this project, I worked with a dataset provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to analyze emissions across the United States in 2023. The goal was to build a Databricks‑powered dashboard that breaks down where emissions are coming from and how they vary by location and population.

### What I Did: 
- Used Databricks to ingest, clean, and transform, and visualize an emissions datasets. 
- Analyzed emissions at the state and county levels to identify the highest‑emitting regions. 
- Calculated emissions per capita and emissions per area to provide deeper context beyond raw totals. 
- Built visualizations to help the EPA understand: 
 - Which states and counties contribute the most emissions 
 - How emissions compare relative to population size 
 - Geographic patterns and hotspots across the country 

### Outcome: 
The final dashboard provides a clear, data‑driven view of emissions distribution across the U.S., helping stakeholders quickly identify problem areas and make informed environmental decisions.

## Interpretation

Here’s a clear, professional interpretation of your dashboard — the kind of explanation you’d give in a portfolio, presentation, or LinkedIn post. I’ll walk through each visual and what it reveals.

##  ✅ **Dashboard Interpretation: United States Emissions Breakdown (2023)**

### 🌍 **1. Continental U.S. Emissions Map**
The map provides a geographic overview of emissions across the United States. States with larger or denser markers indicate higher total emissions. This immediately highlights regional patterns — for example, heavier emissions in parts of Texas, Florida, Illinois, and California. It gives a quick visual sense of where pollution is concentrated nationwide.

### 👥 **2. Emissions vs Population Scatter Plot**
This chart compares population size with emissions per person.  
The key insight shown on the dashboard — **“Higher populations tend to have lower emissions per person”** — suggests that densely populated states often have more efficient energy use, better infrastructure, or more urbanized living patterns that reduce per‑capita emissions.  
Meanwhile, less populated areas may rely more on high‑emission industries or have fewer efficiency measures in place.

### 🥧 **3. Top 10 States Contributing 51% of Total Emissions**
The pie chart reveals that emissions are heavily concentrated in a small group of states.  
Notably:
- **Texas (20.63%)** and **Florida (16.47%)** alone make up over a third of national emissions.  
- Other major contributors include **Ohio, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, California, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina**.

This concentration shows that targeting emissions policies in just a handful of states could significantly impact national totals.

### 📊 **4. Top Emitting Counties**
The bar chart highlights the counties with the highest total emissions.  
The top contributors include:
- **Maricopa County, AZ (9.81M mT CO₂e)**  
- **Harris County, TX (9.68M)**  
- **Cook County, IL (8.11M)**  
- **Miami‑Dade County, FL (5.62M)**  
- **Dallas County, TX (5.43M)**  

These counties are typically large population centers or industrial hubs, which explains their high emissions. This view helps pinpoint specific localities where interventions could be most effective.

### ✅ **Overall Insight**
The dashboard paints a clear picture of U.S. emissions in 2023:

- Emissions are **geographically uneven**, with certain states and counties dominating the totals.  
- **Population size doesn’t directly correlate with higher per‑person emissions** — in fact, the opposite trend appears.  
- A small number of states and counties account for a **disproportionately large share** of national emissions.  
- These insights can guide policymakers toward **targeted, high‑impact environmental strategies**.
